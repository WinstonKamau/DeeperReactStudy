`git clone https://github.com/WinstonKamau/ReactReduxTutorial.git`
- Step 4: On the terminal change the directory into the created git repo by using the command `cd ReactReduxTutorial`
- Step 5: Run the command `npm install` to install the pakage dependencies of the project that are stored in the package.json file.

## Testing

This project uses mocha to test.

To run the tests once and get the results run the command `npm test`.

To run the tests under watch mode run the command `npm test -- --watch`

The development environment set up allows test to be run every time during hot reloading, therefore the command `npm start` will also run the tests.
